    <p>Editorial Responsibility, Integrity and Further Development of MACS

Role of the Editorial Body
The Minimum Acceptable Crypto Standard (MACS) is governed by an editorial body.
The editorial body is responsible for:
•	the coherence of the standard,
•	the versioning and publication of binding versions,
•	the preservation of the substantive integrity of MACS.
Binding versions of MACS are published and versioned exclusively by the editorial body.
Other versions, adaptations or paraphrased forms do not constitute MACS compliance.
No ownership or exclusivity claims with respect to the standard are asserted.

Editor
Editor of the MACS Core v1.0
Daniel Schröter
The editorial role does not constitute a certification, advisory or liability function.

Nature of the Standard
MACS is an open reference standard.
It is deliberately designed to:
•	be technology- and asset-neutral,
•	avoid privileging specific products, providers or implementations,
•	remain applicable independently of market opinions, narratives or interests.
MACS defines minimum requirements for governance and responsibility
and does not establish design guidelines or optimization benchmarks beyond this minimum level.

Versioning and Stability
The MACS Core follows a strict versioning logic:
•	Core versions are content-frozen and constitute the binding reference framework.
•	Amendments to the Core are made only in the case of material adjustment requirements and result in a new major version.
•	Clarifications or thematic additions are addressed exclusively through annexes.
The current binding version is published on this website.

Annexes
Annexes serve the purpose of:
•	thematic clarification of specific aspects,
•	contextualization of particular use cases,
•	raising awareness of potential regulatory, organizational or technological implications, without comprehensively regulating or assessing them.
Annexes are not part of the MACS Core and do not alter its scope or applicability.

Scope Limitation
MACS does not constitute:
•	legal, tax or audit advice,
•	a certification or quality statement,
•	a guarantee of regulatory or economic outcomes.
The application of MACS remains the sole responsibility of the respective organization.

Further Development
The further development of MACS takes place in a manner that is:
•	transparent,
•	versioned,
•	traceably documented.
Suggestions, comments or discussion inputs may be considered,
but do not establish any entitlement to modification or inclusion.
