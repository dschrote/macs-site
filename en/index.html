    <h1>MACS</h1>
    <p class="small">Minimum Acceptable Crypto Standard</p>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <p>The Minimum Acceptable Crypto Standard (MACS) is a governance reference framework for the handling of cryptographically secured digital assets.
MACS defines minimum requirements for decision-making structures, responsibilities, documentation and control mechanisms that organizations should fulfill in order to ensure a structured, traceable and non-negligent handling of crypto assets.
The standard is addressed to organizations that use crypto assets, intend to use them, or have deliberately decided not to do so – as well as to advisors, auditors and control functions that must assess compliance with a minimum governance standard in a factual and structured manner.

What MACS is
MACS is:
•	a technology- and asset-neutral minimum standard,
•	a governance and responsibility framework,
•	a reference point for internal policies, audits and reporting,
•	deliberately kept minimal to ensure broad applicability.
MACS addresses the question of whether and how organizations assume responsibility – not which technology or which product is used.

What MACS is not
MACS is not:
•	a technical specification,
•	a product or vendor recommendation,
•	legal, tax or audit advice,
•	a certification or quality seal.
The application of MACS is at the sole responsibility of the organization and does not replace individual professional advice.

The Standard
•	MACS Core v1.0 – German Version (Master Version)
•	MACS Core v1.0 – English Version (Authoritative Translation)
The MACS Core v1.0 is content-frozen and constitutes the binding reference framework of the standard.
Any further specification is addressed exclusively through subsequent annexes.

Governance and Maintenance
MACS is maintained as an open reference standard.
The editorial body is responsible for the coherence, versioning and integrity of the standard.
Binding versions of MACS are published and versioned exclusively by the editorial body.
No ownership or exclusivity claims are asserted.
Further information on governance, maintenance and update logic is provided on the corresponding page.

Referencing
MACS is freely accessible and may be cited and referenced.
To ensure consistent application, MACS provides recommended wording for referencing the standard in policies, reports and audit documentation.
